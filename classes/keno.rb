# ### Keno Rules

# "Choose 15 numbers between 1 and 80.
# And then wait for the house to draw 20 numbers. 
# If a certain number of your picks come up, you win. 
# You can choose how many 'races' you'd like to play with that 15 number set.
# Each race costs $1 and the typical ticket is 7 races ($7)."
